  paragraph: I learned HTML for the first time when I was in high school, and since then I've been participating in a lot of web projects mostly working as a front-end developer. As I got better in web development, <b>web accessibility</b> was one thing I started to care about. Although there was an official accessibility guideline for web developers to comply with, most websites do not follow this guideline in reality. I thought there should be some other way to tackle the problem of web accessibility, which is the initial motivation for SoundGlance project.<br><br> I and Kiroong started this project with the help of X-corps research institute and Siloam Center for the Blind People. Then, I continued this project while I was working at <a target='_blank' href='https://hcil.snu.ac.kr'>SNU HCI Lab</a>.

  paragraph: I started this project when I was <b>freshman</b> at college. I took a course called 'project when I was <b></b> freshmanat college. I took a 'Management Sciencecourse called freshman taught by Professor Changhee Kim, and this project was initially an assignment fwhere. Then, I took another class called 'Operations Management' taught by Professor Changhee Kim, where this project was initially an assignment. Then, I took another class called 'Management Science' also taught by Prof. Kim. Here, I worked more on this project and completed it. So this was actually something I finished when I was a sophomore. <br><br>Next year, when I became a junior, I won first prize at a competition held by Korean Production and Operations Management Society (KOPOMS) by presenting this project. Then, Prof. Kim recommended submitting the completed work to a journal called Sustainability to me. That's how this work got published. However, since I had no time when submitting this article, I just hired a expert to translate my manuscript, but now that I look more into it, translation is kind of bad. Please keep in mind that the I only wrote the Korean version.<br><br>The paper is about 'what is needed for open source software projects to be efficient?'. Linus' Law celebrates the 'many eyeballs' as the key advantage of open source projects, but when it comes to efficiency, 'many eyeballs' could be a double-bladed saw. By mining and analyzing the data collected from GitHub open source projects, this paper provides several implications about the efficiency of open source projects.

  paragraph: Chartmetric is a self-service tool that features a beautifully designed dashboard that combines hundreds of thousands of real-time data points across multiple music platforms (e.g., Spotify, iTunes). <br><br> In 2017 fall semester, I went to University of Southern California (USC) as an exchange student.

  desc: What people think, what data say, and what media highlight
  paragraph: The topic of my project was refugees, more specifically the Yemeni muslim refugees coming to Jeju island in South Korea. To narrow down the scope of the topic, I tried to put emphasis on the question if the refugees are dangerous and likely to be involved in a crime in particular. I didn’t explicitly answer the question, but instead tried to focus more on delivering the data itself so that the reader wouldn’t feel that they are being forced to be on one side. One example is the case of Sweden in which I showed both increasing and decreasing crime rate due to accepting refugees. This implies that the number of refugees have nothing to do with crime rate, showing neither positive nor negative correlation. <br><br> I spent a lot of time on searching for the factual data—I even read the German official police report using Google translation in order to keep the objectivity using the rawest data. Because of this, the resulting infographic was less visually engaging, and sometimes even misleading due to wrong usage of visual devices.<br><br>The infographic first points out what the people think about the refugees, which has also been a motivation for this project. Then, it points out how crime rate of refugees or foreigners are not so different with other people, giving example of Germany, Norway, and South Korea. Lastly, it suggests that maybe the reason for the difference between people's perspective and what data really says is partially because of what media highlight.
