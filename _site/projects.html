As I got better in web development, <b>web accessibility</b> was one thing I started to care about. Although there was an official accessibility guideline for web developers to comply with, most websites did not follow this guideline in reality. I thought there should be some other way to tackle the problem of web accessibility than just to rely on each developer, which is the initial motivation for SoundGlance project.<br><br> So I and Kiroong started this project with the help of X-corps research institute and Siloam Center for the Blind People. Then, I continued this project while I was working at <a target='_blank' href='https://hcil.snu.ac.kr'>SNU HCI Lab</a>.<br><br> <strong>Abstract.</strong> Screen readers have become a core assistive technology for blind web users to browse web pages. Although screen readers can convey the textual information or structural properties of web pages, they cannot deliver their overall impression. Such a limitation hinders blind web users from obtaining an overview of the website, which non-blind people can do in a short time. As such, we present SoundGlance, a novel application that briefly delivers an auditory summary of web pages. SoundGlance supports the screen reader users by converting the important glanceable cues of the pages into sound. The feasibility of the prototype was examined in a pilot study with fourteen blind people. Several practical insights were derived from the experiment."

With this data, I found the shortest path within six degrees that starts from my direct friends and comes back to me on Facebook. Also, I collected data of recent closeness by combining the number of mentions each friend is mentioned in my recent SNS notifications with my subjective closeness. My intention was to briefly check the following two things - (1) Does the concept of “six degrees of Kevin Bacon” also apply to my relationships on Facebook? (2) Does the shortest path have any relationship with recent closeness? The answer for the first question was "most of the time," since there were several exceptions. For the second question, the answer was definitely "yes", since there was a high correlation between recent closeness and the degree in the shortest path. I thought that my relationships are relatively distributed, because with the other person’s data, I believe the results might have been much simpler ending up with only two or three degrees.<br><br><strong>How to Read.</strong> Each line coming straight out from the center of the circle represents my direct friend who is one degree away from me. The innermost part of the circle is recent closeness visualized as a line graph. Then, the innermost node refers to the friend of my friend, not my direct friend. So if the number of degrees is 2, the path is ‘my friend - friend’s friend - me’. If the path was found within six degrees, the vertices and edges were colored gray, whereas if not, the vertices and edges were colored blue—the vertices of me myself were colored yellow. The dark blue zone corresponds to an infinite zone implying that the connection didn’t come back to me yet.<br><br><img src='https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c68dfaf932ee05a0e085541a602eec4/tumblr_inline_pjzlchpmns1w8f964_540.gif' width='400'><br><br><strong>Implementation.</strong> For implementation, I used d3.js, which was also introduced in class by Professor Hong. Since d3.js is easily used together with web standards, I made an interactive version—nothing special except for tooltips, export function, and the buttons to check the small multiples—on the web as the photo above."

To narrow down the scope of the topic, I tried to put emphasis on the question if the refugees are dangerous and likely to be involved in a crime in particular. I didn’t explicitly answer the question, but instead tried to focus more on delivering the data itself so that the reader wouldn’t feel that they are being forced to be on one side. One example is the case of Sweden in which I showed both increasing and decreasing crime rate due to accepting refugees. This implies that the number of refugees have nothing to do with the crime rate, showing neither positive nor negative correlation. <br><br> I spent a lot of time searching for factual data—I even read the German official police report using Google translation in order to keep the objectivity using the rawest data. Because of this, the resulting infographic was less visually engaging, and sometimes even misleading due to wrong usage of visual devices.<br><br>The infographic first points out what the people think about the refugees, which has also been a motivation for this project. Then, it points out how crime rate of refugees or foreigners are not so different from other people, giving example of Germany, Norway, and South Korea. Lastly, it suggests that maybe the reason for the difference between people's perspective and what data really says is partially because of what media highlight."

We won <b>first place at a competition for developing a school-related service</b> held by <a target='_blank' href='https://snulife.com'>SNULife</a>, which is a web-based community for SNU students. Shashagungun is a coined term derived from Korean idiom 'Sasagungun (사사건건)' combined with 'Sha (샤)' that is symbolic of SNU.<br><br><strong>Motivation.</strong> My idea about Shashagungun started a long time ago. I used to design numerous posters, but as time passed, I felt bad about my posters stuck useless in my laptop -- not only mine, but many other high-quality posters lasting only for a short period and then thrown out to bin. <br><br> Furthermore, this was tragedy for not only the designers, but also students in general. Information on school events, particularly the unofficial ones held by students, was so unorganized that students often were confused or never found out the events. Something had to be done to get the posters organized in a single space. <br><br> So these are why I came up with the idea of bringing the posters online to create an online platform where (1) students can easily search and obtain information on school events, and (2) at the same time designers can preserve their precious efforts on the posters."
